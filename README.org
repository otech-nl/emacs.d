#+TITLE: My Emacs configuration

I tend to bounce between Emacs and other editors (UltraEdit, Sublime, VS Code, ...). 
When I am using Emacs I tend to grow my config until it feels too big. An then I start over.

So, here it is. Iâ€™ll be working with this for a while.

* 2019

Trying to go back to (mostly) vanilla Emacs, with minimal config.

* 2018

Back to a custom config, using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]].

* 2017: Prelude

I decided to give Prelude a go. This is the contents of my ~personal~ directory.

After some initial misgivings (mainly due to having to relearn Prelude key strokes vs custom ones) I find that my Prelude customization is much smaller than my vanilla Emacs one.
