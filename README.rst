My Emacs Prelude personal directory
===================================

Initial thoughts
-----------------

After maintaining a custom Emacs `init.el <https://gist.github.com/otech-nl/a31925696c96b8314d284b23626e1979>`_ for a while, I decided to give `Prelude <https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude>`_ a go.

After some initial misgivings (mainly due to having to relearn Prelude key strokes vs custom ones) I find that my Prelude customization is much smaller than my vanilla Emacs one.

So, here it is. I'll be working with this for a while.
